To test out our program, we employed the use of 16 threads which represent the amount of cores that the test runner’s computer has. Our parallel algorithm was able to find the sum of primes between 1 - 5,000,000 seven times faster than our sequential algorithm which was an expected outcome due to the nature of a parallel algorithm.
